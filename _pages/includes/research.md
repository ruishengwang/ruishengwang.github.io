# Research

In general, I am interested in [Geomatics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geomatics), [Computer Vision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision) 
and interdisciplinary topics of [Geomatics Engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geomatics#Geomatics_engineering) and [Computer Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science). 
A particular focus of mine is combining Computer Science with Geomatics to solve problems within each field, 
and to promote their disciplinary convergence. My research follows the themes of photogrammetry, computer vision, and remote sensing with a 
focus on mapping, especially point cloud processing. 

Specifically, my research areas of focus include development of intelligent algorithms and computational tools for information extraction, 
3D mapping and modeling of real world environments using data acquired from different platforms with different sensors. 
Examples include airborne/spaceborne imaging using active sensors (e.g. LiDAR) and/or passive sensors (e.g. panchromatic camera), 
ground-based or vehicle-borne based sensing techniques (e.g. hand-held shooting, mobile mapping), and mobility data (e.g. GPS traces).
